# ETL-Helper
a little helper to help find the probable title

### Overview

An analyst "John Doe" in a [reserved name] company receive monthly reports of the results of some machines, that reports majorly are in excel; all the reports are hand filled. In the process to most common mailformed data and need to understand is the "TitleOfGame", in an internal process all the data need to be formated to upload automatically to a server and evidently the malformed title need to be linked to their correct title in a dictionary table.

### Objective

The last described process is worked by hand and is time consuming as it is a sensitive process and needs to be monitored, it cannot be completed automatically. So the proposed solution is a little helper to help find the probable title by Similarity of Characters.

### Data

Due to data sensitivity and privacy policies, I only have the necessary part of the database structure and some examples, then I extract or infer the metadata I need to make a synthetic information to test the little helper. In this case, to show the work I change the column names to comply with privacy policies.
